- `"days_lower"` (default `250`): don't adjust the scheduling for cards that would (without this) addon get an interval of equal/less than ___ days:
- `"days_upper"` (default `360`): full reduction for cards that would (without this) addon get an interval of equal/more than ___ days (very mature). Intervals in between "days_lower" and "days_upper" are decreased in a linear way.
- `"reduce_to"` (default `80`): in percent, full reduction means reduce the interval that would (without this) addon be applied to  ___ %
- `"ease_min"` (default `150`): In general this add-on changes the scheduler for cards with an interval that's larger than `"days_upper"`. You can disable this modification for cards that have very low ease values. If you use a reduction to 75% for very mature cards and apply this to a card that has an ease value of 130% the next interval would only be 97,5% if you press good. This is too low. I like a Anki's settings for minimal interval growth so I divide the loweast ease value Anki allows (130) by `"redcue to"` and get 150. You might want to further increase this value if you use a an interval modifier that's much lower than 100. To effectivly disable it set it to a very low value like "0" (not False) A verbose name for this variable would be "use_unmodified_scheduler_for_very_mature_cards_if_ease_lower_equal_to"
- `"ease_max"` (default `350`): If you often press "easy" or start with a high value for "initial ease" you might end up with very mature cards that have very big ease ratings. For thease an interval reduction by `"reduce_to"` might not suffice. To disable this option set it to a very high value like 9999 (not False). A verbose name for this variable would be "for_very_mature_cards_ignore_ease_values_over_x_and_apply_the_follwing_value/multiplicator"
- `"delay: percentage"` (default is `100`) delay handling: If you review late Anki calculates the next interval based on the actual prior interval, not the scheduled one. But Anki doesn't always use the full actual interval = the full delay. This is only done for the easy button, for the good button half of the delay is used and for the hard button a quarter of the delay is used. This might be too aggressive for very mature cards. So you can set a modifier that only a fraction of the actual delay is used for the computations that Anki performs for hard/good/easy. By default this option is disabled = the modifier is set to 100%. Instead of modifying the delay for all cards, you can limit this to very mature cards with `"delay: don't modify delay for cards with ivls below"`.
- `"rep_count_limit"` ( default `0`): If `>0`, the more reps a card has, the more aggressively its growth is reduced. So, when a card has been repeated many times and reach mature interval level with many reps start immediately be growing logarithmically. Cards that reached mature interval levels with a few reps - are actually very easy - will be allowed to continue to grow more exponentially
